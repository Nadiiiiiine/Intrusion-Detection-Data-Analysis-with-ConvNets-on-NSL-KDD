Intrusion Detection using neural network is a very popular research work. The presented model is a neural network solution built with Keras’s Sequential API and contains 
two experimental models for both multiclass and binary data . 
The model is benchmarked with the NSL-KDD dataset (improved version of the KDD CUP 99 dataset).

the second notebook contain data analysis and vizualisation to help with the predection.
